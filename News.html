    <p>8 Tips For Better Fall Portrait Photos <ul>Scout your location close to shoot day
You can look out your window and see amazing foliage today, but depending on the weather, it could literally almost all be gone by tomorrow. All it takes is one frost or some strong wind and your amazing autumn backdrop becomes a skeletal arrangement of bare branches that looks like something right out of True Detective.
Scouting your spot is basic portrait photography 101, but don't wait a whole week between your scouting trip and the shoot. Colors can change, leaves can fall, some places like parks even close off sections for the winter.
The Weather Channel actually keeps a pretty handy regional guide that lets you know what phase the leaves are in at any given time.</ul></p>

    <p>Let's face it. We’re all gear-junkies and tech-geeks whether we choose to admit it or not. Chances are that many of us have made hundreds of purchases related to photography over the years, but I’d venture to say that not all of those purchases have been as impactful as others. Here are five purchases that I certainly don’t regret.
DX to FX
I’ll spare you the boredom that would soon follow reading the list of my first digital cameras – It’s just not impressive or special by any means. Instead, I’ll start at when I upgraded from DX format Nikon bodies to FX format; something that I certainly consider monumental in terms of the purchases I’ve made thus far.</p>
